# artclass (Work in progress)
Prediction of art style of paintings with ML

## TODO

- [ ] Finish training art classification model
- [ ] Have working web app on google colab with pyngrok
- [ ] Work on blog post, readme, summary

## README

*artclass* is a web app that classifies images of paintings according to their art style. A live demo is available at ...

The model configuration used is *Resnet*

It is a fork of [GokuMohandas](https://github.com/GokuMohandas)' repository [MLOps](https://github.com/GokuMohandas/MLOps), and follows the same project structure. The original repository had an example for NLP; *artclass* has an Image Classification model from Torchvision ([*resnet18*](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html#torchvision.models.resnet18)) that was trained on the [*WikiArt*](https://github.com/cs-chan/ArtGAN/tree/master/WikiArt%20Dataset) dataset.
